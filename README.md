# ‚ûï Version Increment

## üìÑ Use

### ‚å®Ô∏è Example

```yaml
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Get next version
        uses: reecetech/version-increment@2021.11.2
        id: version
        with:
          scheme: semver
          increment: patch

      - name: Build image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          push: false
          tags: "example/application:${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}"
          context: .
```

### üîñ semver
This action will detect the current latest _normal_ semantic version (semver) from the tags in
a git repository.  It will increment the version as directed (by default: +1 to
the patch digit).  Both the current latest and the incremented version are
reported back as outputs.

Normal semantic versions are made up of a major, minor and patch digit.  Normal
versions do not include pre-release versions, or versions with build meta-data.

e.g. `1.2.7`

See: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

### üìÖ calver (semver compliant)

Optionally, this action can provide semver compliant calendar versions (calver).
In this calver scheme, the semver  major, minor and patch digits map to year,
month and release digits.

Note: to be semver compliant, digits must not have leading zeros.

e.g. `2021.6.2`

| semver | calver  | example | note |
| :---   | :---    | :---    | :--- |
| major  | year    | `2021`  |
| minor  | month   | `6`     |
| patch  | release | `2`     | The *n*th release for the month |

If the current latest normal version is not the current year and month, then the year and month digits will be
set to the current year and month, and the release digit will be reset to 1.

### üéã Default branch vs. any other branch

**Default branch**

The action will return a _normal_ version if it is detected that the current commit is on the default branch (usually `main`).

Examples:
* `1.2.7`
* `2021.6.2`

**Any other branch**

The action will return a _pre-release_ version if any other branch is detected (e.g. `new-feature`, `bugfix/foo`, etc).  The _pre-release_ portion of the version number will be the literal string `pre.` followed by the git commit ID short reference SHA (trimmed of any leading zeros).

Examples:
* `1.2.7-pre.41218aa78`
* `2021.6.2-pre.32fd19841`
